I am an explorer

Searching for the origins of our universe

And charting a safer path to other worlds

I am a helper

Moving us forward one step at a time

And giving voice to every emotion

(I love you, I love you)

I am a healer

Modeling the future of medicine

And finding the needle in a haystack when every second counts

I am a visionary

Uncovering masterpieces lost to the ages

And finding new adventures in a galaxy far, far away

I am a builder

Driving perfection in everything we create

I am even the narrator of the story you are watching (of the story you are watching)

And the composer of the music

And when the world faces its greatest challenge

I give us the power to take it on together

I am AI
